# Pulse CMS Languages

Language files for Pulse CMS. Please contribute and improve on these and download freely to use in your Pulse CMS projects. 

## Pulse 5

Since Pulse 4.6, we have shipped Pulse with English, German and Japanese. Pulse 5 will ship with these also. 

_But_, if there are any other "completed" Pulse 5 language files, they can also ship with the downloadable Pulse core files so you can select the language from the settings dropdown, without needing to come here to get the language file.
